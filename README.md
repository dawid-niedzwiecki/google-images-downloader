**Google Images Downloader**

Create a directory called `pliki`
Inside it, create a text file called `test.txt` and insert all keywords you wish to look up
Create an empty `errors.txt` in the `pliki` directory aswell
Create an `images` directory in the same place, where you placed your `gid.js` script
Run the script via `node ./gid.js`
Wait for the download to finish
Done :)
