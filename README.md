Create a directory called `pliki`__
Inside it, create a text file called `test.txt` and insert all keywords you wish to look up__
Create an empty `errors.txt` in the `pliki` directory aswell__
Create an `images` directory in the same place, where you placed your `gid.js` script__
Run the script via `node ./gid.js`__
Wait for the download to finish__
