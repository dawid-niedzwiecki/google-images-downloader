**Google Images Downloader**

1. Create a directory called `pliki`  
2. Inside it, create a text file called `test.txt` and insert all keywords you wish to look up  
3. Create an empty `errors.txt` in the `pliki` directory aswell  
4. Create an `images` directory in the same place, where you placed your `gid.js` script  
5. Run the script via `node ./gid.js`  
6. Wait for the download to finish  
Done :)
